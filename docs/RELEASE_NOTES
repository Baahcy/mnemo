The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H5 (4.1.0).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage. For more information on Mnemo,
visit http://www.horde.org/apps/mnemo.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Mnemo H5 (4.0) versions are:
    * Added ActiveSync synchronization of notes.
    * Small improvements.
