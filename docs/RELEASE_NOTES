The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H4 (3.0).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is considered feature complete but there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production
data. Migration of data from earlier versions has not been fully tested yet and
is not supported.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

To install Mnemo, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Mnemo with the following command:

  pear install horde/mnemo-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Mnemo version H4 (3.0-ALPHA1) are:

    * Fixed PDF generation.
    * Fixed encrypting and decrypting of notes.

The full list of changes (from version H4 (3.0-ALPHA1)) can be viewed here:

Have fun!

The Horde Team.
